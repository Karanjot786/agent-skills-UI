### `watch`

Watch for skill file changes and auto-sync across all agent directories.

```bash
skills watch [dir] [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --agent <agents...>` | Agents to sync to (default: all) |
| `--debounce <ms>` | Debounce delay in milliseconds (default: 500) |

Uses Node.js built-in `fs.watch` for file monitoring (no additional dependencies). When a `.md` file changes in the watched directory, it automatically copies the updated file to all target agent directories.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Watch global skills directory, sync to all agents
skills watch

# Watch a custom directory
skills watch ./my-skills

# Watch and sync to specific agents only
skills watch --agent cursor,claude

# Custom debounce
skills watch --debounce 1000
```

**Output:**
```
👁️  Watch Mode

  Watching: /Users/you/.antigravity/skills
  Syncing to: cursor, claude, copilot, codex, antigravity, ...
  Press Ctrl+C to stop.

  ⟳ 09:15:32 frontend-design changed
    ✓ Synced to 5 agent(s)
```

> **Development workflow:** Edit your skill once, and watch mode keeps all 42 agent directories in sync automatically.

### `frozen`

Install skills from the lockfile with pinned versions — deterministic installs like `npm ci`.

```bash
skills frozen [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--verify` | Only verify that installed skills match the lockfile |
| `--strict` | Fail immediately on first mismatch |

**Modes:**

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Default (restore) | Re-clones skills from their recorded sources with pinned versions |
| `--verify` | Checks whether installed skills exist at their canonical paths |
| `--strict` | Aborts on first failure (useful for CI) |

**Supported source types:**
- `github` — Clones from GitHub with optional commit checkout
- `private-git` — Clones from private Git repos with auth
- `local` — Verifies local source path still exists

**Examples:**
```bash
# Restore all skills from lockfile
skills frozen

# Verify mode — check without modifying
skills frozen --verify

# Strict mode for CI pipelines
skills frozen --verify --strict
```

**Output (verify mode):**
```
❄️  Frozen Install (verify mode)
  Found 73 skill(s) in lockfile.

  ✔ frontend-design ✓ verified
  ✖ typescript-pro ✗ missing
  ✖ react-expert ✗ missing

  Summary: 1 succeeded / 72 failed / 73 total
```

> **CI/CD Integration:** Use `skills frozen --verify --strict` in your CI pipeline to ensure all team members have identical skill installations. Exits with code 1 on any mismatch.
