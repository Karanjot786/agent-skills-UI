### `install` / `add`

Install skill(s) from the marketplace, GitHub repos, URLs, or local directories. Auto-detects platforms or lets you target specific agents.

```bash
skills install [source] [options]
skills add [source] [options]
# Alias: skills i [source]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --agent <agents...>` | Install to specific agents (e.g. `cursor,claude`) |
| `--all` | Install to **all 42 agents** at once |
| `-g, --global` | Install globally (user-wide, home directory) |
| `-s, --skill <skills...>` | Install by marketplace skill name(s) |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip confirmation prompts |

#### Install from Marketplace (`@scope/name`)

The primary way to install skills. Uses the `@author/skillname` scoped format to find and install from the marketplace database (175,000+ skills).

```bash
# Auto-detect: prompts you to pick which agents to install to
skills install @facebook/verify

# Install to specific agents
skills install @facebook/verify -a cursor,claude

# Install to ALL 42 agents
skills install @facebook/verify --all

# Install globally
skills install @lobehub/typescript -g -a cursor

# Using the 'add' alias (identical behavior)
skills add @facebook/verify -a cursor
```

**Output:**
```

#### Install from GitHub (`owner/repo`)

Clone a GitHub repo and install all skills found inside it.

```bash
# Clone and install all skills from a repo
skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
skills install anthropics/courses -a cursor

# Install specific skill from a repo
skills add anthropic/skills@xlsx

# Full GitHub URL also works
skills install https://github.com/anthropics/courses -a cursor
```

#### Install by Skill Name (`-s` flag)

```bash
skills install -s verify -a cursor
skills install -s xlsx,pdf -a cursor,claude
```

#### Install from Local Directory

```bash
skills install ./my-local-skill -a cursor,claude
skills install . -a cursor   # Current directory as skill
```

#### Install from Lock File

When you run `skills install` with no arguments and a `skills.lock` exists, it offers to reinstall all previously installed skills.

```bash
skills install   # Prompts: "Found N skills in lock file. Reinstall all?"
```

#### Error Handling

```bash
# Nonexistent scoped name — graceful error
skills install @nonexistent/skill-xyz
# ✖ Could not find "@nonexistent/skill-xyz" in marketplace

# Nonexistent repo — git clone fails gracefully
skills install nonexistent-owner/nonexistent-repo
# Error: repository not found (exit 1)
```
