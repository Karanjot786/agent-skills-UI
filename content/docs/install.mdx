### `install` / `add`

Install skill(s) from the marketplace, GitHub repos, private Git repos, npm registries, URLs, or local directories. Auto-detects platforms or lets you target specific agents.

> **Tip:** You can use `npx agent-skills-cli install` instead of `skills install` if you haven't installed the CLI globally.

```bash
skills install [source] [options]
skills add [source] [options]
# Alias: skills i [source]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a, --agent <agents...>` | Install to specific agents (e.g. `cursor,claude`) |
| `--all` | Install to **all 42 agents** at once |
| `-g, --global` | Install globally (user-wide, home directory) |
| `-s, --skill <skills...>` | Install by marketplace skill name(s) |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip all prompts (agent selection + skill selection). Installs ALL found skills. |
| `--token <token>` | Authentication token for private Git repos |
| `--registry <url>` | npm registry URL (for `npm:` sources) |

#### Install from Marketplace (`@scope/name`)

The primary way to install skills. Uses the `@author/skillname` scoped format to find and install from the marketplace database (175,000+ skills).

```bash
# Auto-detect: prompts you to pick which agents to install to
skills install @facebook/verify

# Install to specific agents
skills install @facebook/verify -a cursor,claude

# Install to ALL 42 agents
skills install @facebook/verify --all

# Install globally
skills install @lobehub/typescript -g -a cursor

# Using the 'add' alias (identical behavior)
skills add @facebook/verify -a cursor
```

**Output:**
```
📦 Searching for "@facebook/verify"...

Found: verify by facebook
Stars: 242,799
URL: https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/.claude/skills/verify

Installing to: cursor, claude, copilot, ..., zed

✔ Downloaded verify
✔ Installed to .cursor/skills/verify
✔ Installed to .claude/skills/verify
✔ Installed to .github/skills/verify
... (42 agents)

✨ Successfully installed: verify
   Scoped name: @facebook/verify
   Platforms: cursor, claude, copilot, ..., zed
```

#### Install from GitHub (`owner/repo`)

Clone a GitHub repo and install all skills found inside it.

```bash
# Clone and install all skills from a repo
skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
skills install anthropics/courses -a cursor

# Install specific skill from a repo
skills add anthropic/skills@xlsx

# Full GitHub URL also works
skills install https://github.com/anthropics/courses -a cursor
```

#### Bulk Install from Repo (`-y` flag)

Skip the skill selection prompt and install ALL skills from a repo with one command. Pair `-y` with `-a` to target specific agents.

```bash
# Install all 943 skills from ComposioHQ to claude (no prompt)
skills install @ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills -a claude -y

# Install all 45 skills to cursor and claude
skills add github/awesome-copilot -a cursor,claude -y

# All skills to all 42 agents, fully non-interactive
skills install @owner/repo --all -y
```

**Output:**
```
📦 Installing from https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills.git

✔ Cloned
ℹ Installing all 943 skills (--yes flag)

Installing skill-creator to Claude Code... ✔
Installing mcp-builder to Claude Code... ✔
...

✨ Installed 943 skill(s)
```

> **Warning:** Some repos contain hundreds or thousands of skills. Using `-y` on a large repo will install every skill it finds. This takes time and disk space. If you only need specific skills, omit `-y` to get the interactive selection prompt, or use `--skill` to pick individual skills:
> ```bash
> skills install @ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills --skill mcp-builder,skill-creator -a claude
> ```

#### Install from Private Git Repos

Install from private or self-hosted Git repositories with automatic credential resolution.

```bash
# SSH (auto-detects SSH keys from ssh-agent or ~/.ssh/)
skills install git@github.com:team/private-repo.git
skills install git@gitlab.com:team/internal-skills.git

# HTTPS with explicit token
skills install https://git.company.com/team/repo --token=ghp_xxx

# Token from environment variables
GH_TOKEN=xxx skills install https://github.com/team/private-repo
GITLAB_TOKEN=xxx skills install https://gitlab.com/team/repo
BITBUCKET_TOKEN=xxx skills install https://bitbucket.org/team/repo

# Bitbucket
skills install https://bitbucket.org/team/skills-repo -a cursor

# Self-hosted Git instances
skills install https://git.company.com/team/skills --token=$COMPANY_TOKEN
```

**Auth resolution order:** `--token` flag → env vars → SSH keys → git credential helper → `.netrc` → none (public access)

| Environment Variable | Provider |
|---------------------|----------|
| `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub |
| `GITLAB_TOKEN` / `GL_TOKEN` | GitLab |
| `BITBUCKET_TOKEN` / `BB_TOKEN` | Bitbucket |
| `GIT_TOKEN` | Any Git host |

#### Install from npm Packages

Install skills packaged as npm modules (public or private registries).

```bash
# Public npm packages
skills install npm:chalk
skills install npm:@anthropic/skills

# Scoped package with version or tag
skills install npm:@company/skills@1.1.1
skills install npm:@company/skills@latest

# Private npm registry
skills install npm:@company/skills --registry https://npm.company.com
```

#### Install by Skill Name (`-s` flag)

```bash
skills install -s verify -a cursor
skills install -s xlsx,pdf -a cursor,claude
```

#### Install from Local Directory

```bash
skills install ./my-local-skill -a cursor,claude
skills install . -a cursor   # Current directory as skill
```

#### Install from Lock File

When you run `skills install` with no arguments and a `skills.lock` exists, it offers to reinstall all previously installed skills.

```bash
skills install   # Prompts: "Found N skills in lock file. Reinstall all?"
```

#### `.skillsrc` Configuration

Create a `.skillsrc` or `.skillsrc.json` in your project root (or `~/.skillsrc` globally) to pre-configure private sources:

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "name": "company-gitlab",
      "type": "git",
      "url": "https://gitlab.company.com",
      "auth_env": "COMPANY_GIT_TOKEN"
    },
    {
      "name": "company-npm",
      "type": "npm",
      "registry": "https://npm.company.com",
      "scope": "@company"
    }
  ],
  "defaults": {
    "agent": "cursor",
    "global": false
  }
}
```

Config is loaded from: project `.skillsrc` → home `~/.skillsrc` (first found wins).

#### Error Handling

```bash
# Nonexistent scoped name — graceful error
skills install @nonexistent/skill-xyz
# ✖ Could not find "@nonexistent/skill-xyz" in marketplace

# Auth failure — helpful error with env var suggestions
skills install https://gitlab.com/team/private-repo
# ✖ Authentication failed for https://gitlab.com/team/private-repo
#   Set GITLAB_TOKEN or GL_TOKEN environment variable, or use --token flag.
#   For SSH, ensure your key is added: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Nonexistent repo — git clone fails gracefully
skills install nonexistent-owner/nonexistent-repo
# Error: repository not found (exit 1)
```
